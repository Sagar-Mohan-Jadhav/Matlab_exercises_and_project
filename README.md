# Matlab_exercises_and_project
I have been working on MATLAB since the start of March 2022 at first I invested my time in learning the basics from an Undemy course. Later as I progressed into more and more complex tasks I started doing my own projects and I wanted to share my progress to whomever it interests with this Github repository.
