% To run the public function, call it in this script as pub_wave(Simple_wave_function,model_type).
% model_type for different waves is as follows.
% 0 ------ sine wave
% 1 ------ cosine wave
% 2 (or any other number) -------- tangent wave
% ex. to display cosine wave, type below, pub_wave(Simple_wave_function, 1)
pub_wave(Simple_wave_function, 5);
